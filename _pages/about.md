I'm a PhD student at LTI-CMU and ISR-IST, under the CMU Portugal program. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof Joao Paulo Costeira (IST), Manuel Marques (IST) and Alexander Hauptmann (CMU). My research focuses on the intersection of language and vision, with an emphasis on structured and hierarchical representation learning for tasks like recognition and generation. Before starting my PhD, I worked on efficient pose graph optimization algorithms for 3D reconstruction and spent six months as a research intern at Airbus, in Toulouse. In 2024, I joined Meta Reality Labs as a research scientist intern in Zurich, to conduct research on 3D generation.
