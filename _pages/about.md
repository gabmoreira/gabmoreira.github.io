I'm a 4th year PhD student at LTI-CMU and ISR-IST, under the CMU Portugal program. I'm advised by Joao Paulo Costeira, Manuel Marques (IST) and Alexander Hauptmann (CMU). My main research interest lies at the intersection between language and vision, particularly on structured and hierarchical representation learning for recognition and generation. In 2024, I joined Meta Reality Labs, in Zurich, as a research scientist intern. Prior to my PhD, I did research on efficient pose graph optimization algorithms for 3D reconstruction and spent 6 months as research intern at Airbus, in Toulouse.
