I'm a PhD student at LTI-CMU and ISR-IST, under the CMU Portugal program. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof JP Costeira (IST), Manuel Marques (IST) and Alex Hauptmann (CMU). My research focuses on the intersection of language and vision, with an emphasis on structured and hierarchical representation learning for recognition and generation. Before starting my PhD, I worked on new pose graph optimization algorithms for 3D reconstruction and prior to that I spent six months as a research intern at Airbus. In 2024, I joined Meta Reality Labs as a research scientist intern in Zurich.
