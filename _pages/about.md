I'm a PhD student at LTI-CMU and ISR-IST, under a CMU Portugal scholarship. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof JP Costeira (IST), Manuel Marques (IST) and Alex Hauptmann (CMU). My research has revolved around graphs, currently focusing on the intersection between vision and language, with an emphasis on structured and hierarchical representation learning for recognition and generation. During the summer of 2024, I joined Meta Reality Labs as a research scientist intern. Prior to my PhD, I worked on pose graph optimization and spent six months as a research intern at Airbus.
